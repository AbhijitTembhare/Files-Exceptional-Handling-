        "\n",
        "1.  **: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line, while compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **: What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Exception handling is a mechanism to manage errors that occur during program execution, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "    *   **:** The finally block contains code that is guaranteed to execute regardless of whether an exception was raised or handled.  It's used for cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **: What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Logging is the process of recording events and messages during program execution, useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **: What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** The `__del__` method (destructor) is called when an object is about to be garbage collected, but its use is generally discouraged.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **: What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** `import module_name` imports the entire module, while `from module_name import name` imports specific items from the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **: How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "    *   :You can use multiple `except` blocks, each designed to handle a different type of exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **: What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** The `with` statement ensures that resources (like files) are properly managed, automatically closing them even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  **: What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Multithreading runs multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory. Multiprocessing runs multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **: What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Logging helps in debugging, monitoring program behavior, and identifying issues by providing a record of events.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **: What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Memory management in Python involves allocating and deallocating memory for objects during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **: What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** The basic steps are: `try` (enclose the code that might raise an exception), `except` (handle specific exceptions), and optionally `finally` (code that always executes).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **: Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Effective memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures program stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **: What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "    *   **:** `try` defines the block of code to be monitored for exceptions, and `except` specifies how to handle those exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **: How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Python uses automatic garbage collection to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **: What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "    *   **:** The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised within the corresponding `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **: What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Common logging levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, representing different severities of messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **: What is the difference between `os.fork()` and `multiprocessing` in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** `os.fork()` is a lower-level, Unix-specific system call for creating processes. `multiprocessing` is a higher-level, cross-platform module for managing processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **: What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Closing a file releases system resources, prevents data corruption, and ensures that changes are written to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **: What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** `file.read()` reads the entire file content, while `file.readline()` reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **: What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "    *   **A:** The logging module provides tools for flexible event and message logging in Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.:  What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "    *   :** The `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **: What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Challenges include memory leaks (unreleased memory), memory fragmentation, and the overhead of garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **: How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "    *   **:** You can raise an exception manually using the `raise` keyword followed by the exception type and an optional message.  Example: `raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")`\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **: Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "    *   **:** Multithreading can improve performance in I/O-bound applications by allowing the program to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n"
